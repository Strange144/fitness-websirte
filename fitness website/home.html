      it fosters personal accountability, helps identify patterns and progress,
      and complements a regular exercise routine. While calorie counting may not
      be suitable for everyone and should not be the sole focus of a healthy
      lifestyle, when used mindfully, it can be an effective tool to support
      overall health and well-being. Remember, balance and moderation are key to
      achieving sustainable and long-term success in maintaining a healthy and
      active lifestyle.
