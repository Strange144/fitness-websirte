      In the context of health and fitness, macronutrients are most often
      defined to be the chemical <br />
      compounds that humans consume in large quantities that provide bulk
      energy. Specifically, they <br />
      refer to carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Some definitions also include
      water, air, calcium, <br />
      sodium, chloride ions, and some other substances, along with more typical
      macronutrients, since<br />
      they are needed in large quantities by the human body. In this calculator,
      we only calculate <br />
      daily carbohydrate, protein, and fat needs.<br />

      Micronutrients are another essential part of human nutrition and consist
      of vitamins and dietary <br />
      minerals such as Vitamin A, copper, iron, and iodine. While macronutrients
      are necessary daily in<br />
      amounts on the order of grams, humans typically only need fewer than 100
      milligrams of <br />
      micronutrients each day. In a balanced diet, the recommended ratios for<br />
      protein, fats, and carbohydrates are approximately<br />
      10%-35% of calories from protein, 20%-35% from fats (with a focus on
      healthy unsaturated fats),<br />
      and 45%-65% from carbohydrates (with an emphasis on complex carbs).
      Individual needs may vary,<br />
      so consulting a healthcare professional or dietitian is advisable for
      personalized guidance.
